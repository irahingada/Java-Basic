# Java Basics – Core Concepts Practice

This folder contains my Java practice code from a Udemy course, focusing on core programming concepts that are essential for QA automation and Selenium scripting.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- **Arrays**
  - Declaring and initializing arrays
  - Iterating through elements using `for` and `foreach`
  - Simple array-based logic

- **ArrayList**
  - Creating and adding elements
  - Using `.get()`, `.remove()`, and `.size()`
  - Looping through elements
  - Difference between fixed-size arrays and dynamic ArrayLists

## 👩‍💻 Why It Matters

As a QA Engineer learning automation, it's important to build a strong foundation in Java. Arrays and ArrayLists are often used in test data handling, looping through web elements, and storing API responses.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Java
- Eclipse IDE
